here's a summary of the changes made to resolve the workflow execution errors:

1. __Created `workflows/run_server.py`:__

   - This new Python script is now the recommended way to start the backend server.
   - __Purpose:__ It ensures that the correct `asyncio` event loop policy (`WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy`) and a `ProactorEventLoop` instance are set *before* Uvicorn (the ASGI server for FastAPI) starts. This is crucial on Windows for Playwright to be able to launch browser subprocesses.
   - It explicitly starts Uvicorn pointing to `backend.api:app` and initially disables the `--reload` flag to simplify debugging (it can be re-enabled if desired).

2. __Modified `workflows/backend/api.py`:__

   - Removed the `asyncio` event loop setting code from this file. This logic is now centralized in `workflows/run_server.py` to ensure it executes before Uvicorn initialization.

3. __Modified `workflows/backend/service.py`:__

   - __Workflow Path Correction:__

     - Changed the directory where the service looks for workflow definition files (e.g., `example.workflow.json`). It now looks in the main `workflows/` directory instead of `workflows/tmp/`.
     - The `list_workflows` method was updated to specifically look for files ending with `.workflow.json` in the corrected directory.

   - __Enhanced Error Logging (Intermediate Step):__
     - Added more detailed exception logging (type, message, repr, and traceback) to the `run_workflow_in_background` method. This was crucial for diagnosing the `NotImplementedError`. This detailed logging remains in place.

   - __LLM Initialization Check (Intermediate Step):__
     - Added a check for `self.llm_instance is None` at the beginning of `run_workflow_in_background` to log a specific error if the Google API key wasn't set up for the backend. This also remains.

__In essence:__ The core fix was ensuring the `ProactorEventLoop` is active for the backend server process by using the new `run_server.py` script. The secondary fix involved correcting the path where `WorkflowService` loads workflow definitions. The enhanced logging was a temporary diagnostic step that helped identify the `NotImplementedError` and can be useful for future debugging.
